To set the trash can icon as the Slack app icon:

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Select your Message Deletion Manager app
3. Navigate to "Display Information" in the left sidebar
4. Under "App Icon & Preview", click "Add App Icon"
5. Upload the TrashIcon.png image (green checkmark and red X in trash can)

The icon should be at least 512x512 pixels for best quality.
